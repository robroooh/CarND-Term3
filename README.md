Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Requirements.
Udacity Self-Driving Car Term 3 Simulator [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
  - driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit.
  - given localization, sensor fusion, sparse map of way points.
  - go as close to 50 MPH, don't hit other cars, go fast, change lanes


# Model Documentation
The goal is to drive a car safely using the help of localization, sensor fusion data, and a sparse waypoints. It also should not violate aforementioned rules. This will be divided into 2 main steps.

1. Sensor Fusion & Constructing Waypoints
The waypoints are given in the `data/highway_map.txt`. it gives the sparse waypoints of  0.5 apart which will be loaded to the simulator. The simulator also provide us with the previous waypoints that is useful to predict the state of the ego car in the future. The Sensor Fusion data is used to perceive the location of the cars around us which makes it more convenient to determine whether the ego car is in the safe state or not. After modeling process, I use `spline.h` to help generating Cartesian coordinate points based on Frenet coordinate points before send them to the simulation.


2. Modeling
For the modeling part, I use the method which is based on FSM which there will be a state that a car can go as fast as it wants, and a state that a car need to determine whether to `change left` or `change right`. The cost function will be penalized based on of the speed of the nearest car (in any lane) and the near car. Implies that, if there is a fast car coming, we should stay calm, and if there is a car near by, we should not go that way.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.
